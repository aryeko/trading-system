## Overview
Guard portfolio capital daily. Propose improvements weekly/monthly.

## Features
- **Capital protection** with daily crash and drawdown checks.
- **Portfolio reports** in HTML and JSON formats.
- **Signals & rebalance proposals** for proactive adjustments.
- **Backtests** to validate strategies before deployment.
- **Point-in-time data** for reproducible analysis.
- **CLI orchestration** to coordinate daily and scheduled runs.
- **Notifications** through Slack and email channels.

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aryeko/trading-system
cd trading-system
poetry install

poetry run ts run daily --config data/sample.yaml --holdings data/sample-holdings.json --dry-run
```

Sample onboarding assets live under `data/`. Update the universe, holdings snapshot, and notification settings before running against live capital.

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Evaluate portfolio risk with point-in-time context
poetry run ts risk evaluate --config data/sample.yaml --holdings data/sample-holdings.json

# Execute the full daily pipeline with rebalance proposals
poetry run ts run rebalance --config data/sample.yaml --holdings data/sample-holdings.json --dry-run

# Run a historical backtest across a custom period
poetry run ts backtest run --config data/sample.yaml --start 2024-01-01 --end 2024-06-30 --output reports/backtests/demo
```
